# What's that?

It's JAF-Auto-testing framework. Wrapped around Selenium only, so far, but with capability to wrap any other driver.

Works with Gecko, Webkit and Trident.

## Concepts

...are pretty simple. Browser -> Page -> Component -> Element. Every level has its own access levels

- Browser: navigate through pages, interact with cookies, take screenshots
- Page: run JavaScript, use components and elements
- Component: use inner components and elements
- Element: some basic Selenium interaction, like "Click", "Hover" etc.

## Why use it?

No reason at all. Just moved it to .NET core, though. It's not so cool, but I work on it =)

## Samples

Coming soon...
